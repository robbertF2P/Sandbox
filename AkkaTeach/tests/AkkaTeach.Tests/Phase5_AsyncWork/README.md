# Phase 5 — Async work without blocking

**Question this phase answers:** the mailbox handles one message at a time — so how do I do slow
IO without freezing the actor?

## The problem

```
   ❌ blocking inside a handler

   mailbox: [ Fetch ][ B ][ C ][ D ]
              │
              └─ .Result / .Wait() / await → 2 s
                 B, C and D wait 2 s for no reason.
                 The actor is dead to the world.
```

## The fix: PipeTo

Start the async work, do **not** await it, and pipe the completed result back to yourself as a
new message. The handler returns immediately.

```
   ✅ PipeTo

   handler ── starts Task ──► (external service)
      │                              │
      └─ returns immediately         │ completes later
                                     ▼
   mailbox: [ B ][ C ][ D ][ QuoteReceived ] ◄── arrives as a normal message
                                     │
                                     └─ handled like anything else
```

```csharp
_service.FetchAsync(id).PipeTo(
    Self,
    success: result => new QuoteReceived(result),
    failure: ex     => new QuoteFailed(ex.Message));
```

## Why it is safe

The result comes back **as a message**, so it is processed by the mailbox like any other — one at
a time, on the actor's own thread. No locks, no race on your fields.

```
   ⚠️  Never touch actor state inside a ContinueWith / callback.
       That runs on a thread-pool thread, outside the mailbox guarantee.
       Always route the result back through Self.
```

## Failure is a message too

Map the exception into a normal message (`failure:`) instead of letting it escape. The actor
decides what a failure means — no restart needed for an expected error.

## Tests here

`PipeToDemoActorTests` — mailbox stays responsive while a fetch is in flight, and a failing
service surfaces as a failed-status message rather than a crash.
